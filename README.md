## Short Abstract
Sulfur starvation in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* PAO1 triggers a coordinated response that links sulfur assimilation with iron metabolism and oxidative stress defense. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses revealed strong induction of sulfur-scavenging operons and antioxidant enzymes (Ohr, LsfA, SodB), alongside suppression of iron uptake systems and increased expression of iron storage proteins, consistent with an iron-replete state. This metabolic shift reduces siderophore/phenazine production and attenuates virulence pathways regulated by Fur and PrrF. Our findings highlight a novel sulfur–iron axis that buffers oxidative stress and modulates pathogenicity, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities via nutritional immunity.
